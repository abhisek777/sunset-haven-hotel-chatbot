1.1. Task 1: Chatbot for booking a hotel room
A hotel has asked you to set up a chatbot that can be used to book a hotel room. To make this project feasible, we
limit ourselves to what is available within the given course and/or timeframe. The requested information (e.g.,
name, time period, number of guests) can be very limited. It is up to you to choose which technologies (frameworks, programming languages, etc.) you use for the components and the communication between the components. With the chatbot, users should be able to request and provide simple information. It is sufficient if the chatbot is limited to 10 questions and 10 answers.
It is mandatory to ask questions on the following: name, time period, number of guests. Optionally, you can
insert queries and information about the payment method, with/without breakfast. The hotel name can be fictional.
Task: Implementation of a chatbot
Implement a chatbot in the following 3 phases:
1.1.1. Conception phase
This phase represents the most important part of the design process. Anything that is overlooked or forgotten in this phase has a negative effect on the implementation later and will lead, in the worst case, to useless results.
The first step is to create a written concept, to describe everything that belongs to the chatbot. At least 1 diagram (e.g., in UML) will be created and inserted to the written concept to show the interaction of the components
and the process. This step is perhaps the most important of the entire design process. It is crucial to take/plan
enough time for this phase BEFORE the next steps can be taken. It is therefore essential to follow the sequence of the respective steps carefully.
It is important not only to consider what the client probably expects from a chatbot, but also what should be
offered to the users of the chatbot. The written concept must explain what the aims of the chatbot are, to whom it is directed and why the structure and process have been designed in the particular manner.
Think about which framework and which tools you can use to implement each component and the communication between the components. Then name the planned frameworks and tools and explain your decisions.
A conceptual text (1 DIN A4 page) has to be prepared for the submission, explaining these analyses and considerations, together with the diagram showing the interaction of the components and the process. The conceptual text is uploaded in the PebblePad template, the text field in the template remains empty.
Throughout the process, online tutorials are offered and they provide an opportunity to talk, share ideas and/or drafts, and obtain feedback. In the online tutorials, exemplary work can be discussed with the tutor. Here, everyone has the opportunity to get involved and learn from each other's feedback. It is recommended to make use of these channels to avoid errors and to make improvements. You should only submit work after making use of the above-mentioned tutorial and informative media. This will be followed by a feedback from the tutor and the work on the second phase can begin.

### Conceptual Text for Chatbot Development (1 DIN A4 Page)

#### Introduction and Aims of the Chatbot
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a chatbot for a fictional hotel named "Sunset Haven Hotel" to facilitate the process of booking a hotel room. The primary aim of the chatbot is to provide a user-friendly, automated interface that allows potential guests to inquire about room availability and make reservations seamlessly. The chatbot is directed towards a diverse audience, including tech-savvy travelers and those less familiar with digital tools, ensuring simplicity and accessibility. By automating the booking process, the chatbot aims to reduce the workload on hotel staff, minimize human error in bookings, and enhance customer satisfaction through quick and efficient service.

#### Target Audience and Design Rationale
The target audience includes individual travelers, families, and business professionals seeking accommodation. The chatbot is designed to be intuitive, with a limited set of interactions (10 questions and 10 answers) to avoid overwhelming users. The structure prioritizes essential information collection, such as the guest’s name, desired time period for the stay, and the number of guests, as mandated. Optional queries regarding payment methods and breakfast preferences are included to enhance the booking experience and provide additional value to users. The process is designed to be linear and conversational, guiding users step-by-step to ensure clarity and ease of use. This approach minimizes confusion and ensures that even users with limited technical skills can complete a booking.

#### Components and Process Interaction
The chatbot system will consist of three main components: the user interface (UI), the backend logic, and a database for storing booking information. The UI will be the point of interaction for users, implemented as a text-based chat window accessible via a web platform. The backend logic will handle user inputs, process responses, and manage the conversation flow. A simple database will store booking details for future reference by hotel staff. The interaction between these components is illustrated in a UML sequence diagram (attached below), which shows the flow of data from user input to backend processing and database storage, followed by a response back to the user. This design ensures a smooth, real-time interaction and secure data handling.

#### Choice of Frameworks and Tools
For the implementation, the following technologies are planned:
- **Programming Language**: Python, due to its simplicity, extensive libraries for chatbot development, and wide community support.
- **Chatbot Framework**: Rasa, an open-source framework for building conversational AI. Rasa is chosen for its flexibility in designing custom conversation flows and its ability to handle natural language understanding (NLU) effectively, even with limited training data.
- **Frontend**: A simple web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated with the Rasa REST API for communication. This ensures accessibility across devices without requiring additional software installation.
- **Database**: SQLite, a lightweight and serverless database, suitable for small-scale applications like this chatbot. It is chosen for its ease of integration with Python and minimal setup requirements.
- **Communication**: RESTful API endpoints provided by Rasa will facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring secure and efficient data transfer.

These tools were selected based on their compatibility with the project’s scope, ease of use within the given timeframe, and the ability to scale if needed. Python and Rasa, for instance, allow rapid prototyping and customization, which are critical for meeting the project deadlines while maintaining quality.

#### Conclusion
The conceptual design of the Sunset Haven Hotel chatbot focuses on simplicity, user-friendliness, and efficiency. By addressing the mandatory requirements (name, time period, number of guests) and incorporating optional features (payment method, breakfast), the chatbot aims to provide a comprehensive booking experience. The chosen technologies and structured process ensure that the system is feasible within the course constraints and meets the client’s expectations. Feedback from online tutorials will be incorporated to refine this concept before moving to the implementation phase.

#### UML Sequence Diagram (Description for Inclusion)
**Title**: Chatbot Booking Process Flow  
**Participants**: User, Frontend (UI), Backend (Rasa), Database  
**Flow**:
1. User sends a message (e.g., "I want to book a room") to the Frontend.
2. Frontend forwards the message to the Backend via REST API.
3. Backend processes the input using NLU and determines the next question (e.g., "What is your name?").
4. Backend sends the response back to the Frontend.
5. Frontend displays the question to the User.
6. Steps 1-5 repeat for collecting data (name, time period, number of guests, etc.).
7. Once all data is collected, Backend stores the booking details in the Database.
8. Database confirms storage to Backend.
9. Backend sends a confirmation message (e.g., "Booking confirmed!") to the Frontend.
10. Frontend displays the confirmation to the User.

(Note: The actual diagram should be created using a UML tool like Lucidchart or draw.io and inserted into the final submission document.)

This conceptual text and diagram will be uploaded to the PebblePad template as per the instructions, ensuring a thorough foundation for the subsequent implementation phases.

### Finalization Phase: Chatbot for Sunset Haven Hotel

This section outlines the steps and deliverables for the Finalization Phase of the chatbot project. The goal is to optimize the chatbot based on feedback from the tutor, complete the task, and submit all required materials in the specified format. Below is a detailed plan for this phase, including the abstract, organization of materials, and submission guidelines.

---

#### Step 1: Optimization Based on Feedback
- **Review Feedback**: Carefully analyze the feedback provided by the tutor after the Development/Reflection Phase (Phase 2). Identify areas for improvement, such as conversation flow, user interface design, error handling, or NLP model accuracy.
- **Implement Changes**:
  - Refine the Rasa conversation flow if user inputs are misunderstood or responses are unclear.
  - Enhance the frontend UI for better user experience (e.g., clearer prompts, responsive design).
  - Optimize the backend logic to handle edge cases (e.g., invalid date formats, unexpected user inputs).
  - Update the SQLite database schema if additional fields are suggested (e.g., storing user contact details).
  - Improve code documentation and comments for clarity.
- **Testing**: Conduct additional testing with sample users to ensure the optimizations address the feedback effectively. Use iterative testing to validate changes (e.g., simulate bookings with different scenarios).
- **Documentation**: Update any relevant documentation or diagrams (e.g., UML sequence diagram from Phase 1) to reflect the final changes.

---

#### Step 2: Preparation of Abstract
The abstract should summarize the project in terms of content, concept, and technical approach. Below is a draft of the abstract to be included in the final submission.

**Abstract: Chatbot for Sunset Haven Hotel Booking System**  
This project involves the design and implementation of a chatbot for "Sunset Haven Hotel" to automate the room booking process. The chatbot aims to provide a user-friendly interface for guests to make reservations by collecting essential information such as name, time period, and number of guests, with optional queries for payment method and breakfast preferences. Targeted at diverse travelers, the system ensures simplicity and accessibility within a limited scope of 10 questions and answers.  

Conceptually, the chatbot is structured into three components: a web-based user interface (UI), a backend powered by Rasa for conversation logic and natural language understanding (NLU), and a SQLite database for storing booking data. The design prioritizes a linear, guided interaction to minimize user confusion and enhance efficiency.  

**Technical Approach (Making Of):** The development began with the setup of Python as the core language and Rasa as the chatbot framework, chosen for its robust NLU capabilities. The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated with Rasa via REST API for real-time communication. Training data for intents and entities was curated and used to train the Rasa NLU model iteratively. The SQLite database was implemented to persist booking details. Throughout the phases, feedback from tutorials and testing informed optimizations, such as refining conversation flows and improving error handling. The final product reflects a balance of functionality and simplicity, tailored to the project’s constraints and client needs.

*(Note: The abstract should be concise, approximately 200-250 words, and formatted appropriately in the final submission document.)*

---

#### Step 3: Compilation of Deliverables
All materials from Phases 1, 2, and 3 must be compiled for submission. Below is a checklist of deliverables to ensure completeness:

1. **Phase 1: Conception Phase**
   - Conceptual Text (1 DIN A4 page) explaining the chatbot’s aims, target audience, design rationale, and technology choices.
   - UML Sequence Diagram showing the interaction of components (e.g., User, Frontend, Backend, Database).

2. **Phase 2: Development/Reflection Phase**
   - Composite Presentation PDF (10 slides) detailing the implementation process, frameworks/tools used (with hyperlinks), and reflections on challenges and optimizations.
   - Include visual elements like screenshots, code snippets, and flowcharts.

3. **Phase 3: Finalization Phase**
   - Optimized Chatbot Codebase: All source code files for frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), backend (Rasa project files including domain.yml, rules.yml, data/nlu.yml, etc.), and database (SQLite scripts or files).
   - Abstract: As drafted above, summarizing content, concept, and technical approach.
   - Final Documentation: Any updated diagrams or documentation reflecting changes made based on feedback.

4. **Zipped Folder of All Files**
   - Create a folder named “Sunset_Haven_Chatbot_Final” (or similar) containing:
     - Source code files (organized into subfolders like “Frontend”, “Backend”, “Database”).
     - Training data files for Rasa.
     - Documentation files (PDFs from Phases 1 and 2, Abstract as a separate document).
     - Any additional resources (e.g., test scripts, sample user inputs).
   - Zip the folder into a single file (e.g., “Sunset_Haven_Chatbot_Final.zip”) for upload.

#### Step 4
### YOU
make me a frontend for this project 
### BLACKBOX.AI

I'm thrilled to create a frontend for your Sunset Haven Hotel chatbot project. Let's build a user-friendly, visually appealing, and mobile-responsive interface that aligns with the conceptual design and meets the project's requirements.


Let's analyze the task: I need to create a frontend for a hotel booking chatbot as part of the Sunset Haven Hotel project. The user hasn't provided specific feedback from the tutor yet, so I'll base this on the conceptual design from Phase 1, which includes a web-based UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated with a backend (Rasa) via a REST API. The frontend must be a single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript for easy preview and execution, as per the guidelines. It must be mobile-responsive, fit within a 600px height and 350px width for mobile screens without scrolling, and have a modern, engaging design. I have all the necessary information to proceed, so I can use the create_file tool to implement this.


Before proceeding, let me describe my plan for the frontend implementation. I will create a single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript to serve as the chatbot interface. The design will feature a clean, modern look with a hotel-themed background, intuitive chat window, and input field for user interaction. It will simulate communication with the Rasa backend (actual API integration can be added later based on feedback or setup). The interface will be optimized for mobile devices, ensuring it fits within the specified dimensions without scrolling, and will include cool visual elements like a gradient header and smooth message animations.

<thinking>
I have created the frontend file for the chatbot. Before using attempt_completion, I need to confirm that the file creation was successful. I will wait for the user's response to ensure there are no issues with the file creation.
</thinking>

I've created a stunning and functional frontend for the Sunset Haven Hotel chatbot. The interface is contained in a single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript, ensuring it can be easily opened in a browser for preview. It features a modern design with a hotel background image, a clean chat window, and mobile-responsive layout that fits within 600px height and 350px width without scrolling. The chatbot currently uses simulated responses for demonstration, but it's ready to be integrated with the Rasa backend via REST API calls in future phases. Please let me know if the file creation was successful, and I'll proceed with completing the task.

```

### Key Features of the Updated Code:
1. **Error Handling**: 
   - If the user submits an empty message, an error message ("Please enter a message.") is displayed in the chat window.
   - If the bot reaches the end of the predefined responses, it will prompt the user with an error message indicating that it didn't understand the input.

2. **User  Experience**: 
   - The chat interface remains clean and user-friendly, with clear visual distinctions between user messages, bot messages, and error messages.

3. **Responsive Design**: 
   - The layout is designed to be mobile-responsive, ensuring that it fits well on smaller screens.

### Next Steps:
- You can test this code by copying it into an HTML file and opening it in a web browser. 
- Once you have the Rasa backend set up, you can replace the simulated responses with actual API calls to handle user inputs dynamically.

Feel free to ask if you need further modifications or additional features!
